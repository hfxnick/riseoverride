        <p>Alright, a quick update from us at Override Labs on what we‚Äôve been working on with RiseOverride.</p>
        <p>We're still focused on making it easier to get Articulate Rise to do what you actually need it to do.</p>
        <p>Here‚Äôs a look at the tools we‚Äôre getting ready to roll out, plus a heads-up on other significant features in the pipeline.</p>

        <h2 class="mt-10 mb-4 text-2xl font-bold text-black dark:text-slate-100">What's Coming to RiseOverride</h2>
        <p>We've got several enhancements in the works that we think you'll find useful.</p>

        <h3 class="mt-8 mb-2 text-xl font-semibold text-black dark:text-blue-200">Live CSS Previews ‚Äì See Changes Instantly</h3>
        <p>The current way of working with CSS in Rise usually involves editing your styles, exporting, then uploading somewhere to see if your changes actually worked as expected.</p>
        <p>It‚Äôs a slow feedback loop.</p>
        <p>We're building a <strong>CSS Live Preview</strong> feature.</p>
        <p>The idea is simple: edit your CSS and see the changes happen in real-time, directly in Rise's own Preview mode.</p>
        <p>No more exporting just to check your work. This one is pretty involved, but we think it's a critical improvement and we‚Äôre focused on getting it right.</p>

        <h3 class="mt-8 mb-2 text-xl font-semibold text-black dark:text-blue-200">Batch Patching for SCORM Packages (For Pro Users)</h3>
        <p>For those of you managing a lot of SCORM files ‚Äì like courses for different languages that all need the same custom CSS ‚Äì doing them one by one is tedious.</p>
        <p>So, for Pro users, we're adding <strong>Batch Processing</strong>.</p>
        <p>Soon you'll be able to take one CSS theme file and apply it to up to 10 SCORM packages at once.</p>
        <p>It‚Äôll be designed to be a practical time-saver if you're dealing with volume and need consistency without the repetitive work.</p>

        <h3 class="mt-8 mb-2 text-xl font-semibold text-black dark:text-blue-200">A Better Quick Code Editor (For Everyone)</h3>
        <p>We're also tweaking our built-in code editor. The goal is to make it even quicker and more intuitive for those moments you need to jump in and adjust your CSS or other custom files directly in the extension. We're aiming for just a smoother experience for those fast edits, benefiting all users.</p>

        <h3 class="mt-8 mb-2 text-xl font-semibold text-black dark:text-blue-200">Easier SVG Edits (For Everyone, Free & Pro)</h3>
        <p>If you've ever wanted to quickly tweak an SVG's colour, you know it usually means opening another app, making the change, saving, then re-uploading, or manually editing the svg code.</p>
        <p>It‚Äôs a bit much for simple edits.</p>
        <p>We ran into this enough ourselves that we've been building a straightforward <strong>SVG Editor into RiseOverride</strong>. It has nothing to do with Rise, really‚Äîit‚Äôs just something we built for ourselves that we wanted to share.</p>
        <p>Soon you'll be able to handle those quick adjustments for fills, strokes, and dimensions right where you are.</p>
        <p>It‚Äôs nothing fancy, but it should save time. This will be available for everyone, Free and Pro users, once it's ready.</p>

        <h2 class="mt-10 mb-4 text-2xl font-bold text-black dark:text-slate-100">Your Thoughts?</h2>
        <p>So, those are the things in the pipeline.</p>
        <p>Keep an eye out for these tools in an upcoming update.</p>
        <p>The Pro features like the upcoming Batch Patching are part of what helps us dedicate the time needed to keep building and improving things like the Live Preview.</p>
        <p>We‚Äôre just two people, and this project takes a good chunk of our energy outside of our regular lives, mostly because we see gaps that aren't being filled elsewhere.</p>
        <p>We genuinely want to hear what you think about these planned features, or what else you wish RiseOverride could do.</p>
        <p>Your feedback actually helps us decide where to focus.</p>
        <p>You can <a href="https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/fgadfaegmenmjolnpcmhpnajaigjmego" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">install the extension here</a> and <a href="https://forms.gle/eQKxD7jySctV59ZA6" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">share feedback here</a>. We read it all.</p>

        <p>That‚Äôs it for now.</p>

          At Override Labs, your privacy is important to us. This policy explains how we collect and use your data
          through the RiseOverride Chrome Extension and our website, <strong>overridelabs.ca</strong>.
        </p>
        <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">1. What We Collect</h3>
        <p class="text-sm mb-4">
          We do not collect personal data by default. If you use Pro Mode, submit content, or request support, you may
          provide your email address. This is only used for licensing, communication, and support purposes.
        </p>
        <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">2. Chrome Extension Permissions</h3>
        <ul class="text-sm list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mb-4">
          <li><strong>downloads:</strong> Enables SCORM file interception and patching.</li>
          <li><strong>scripting:</strong> Injects a custom alert into publishing UI when automatic SCORM Patching is
            enabled (Pro users), and will be required to develop roadmap features (like live CSS previews).</li>
          <li><strong>storage:</strong> Stores your custom code locally (and in sync for Pro users).</li>
          <li><strong>alarms:</strong> Supports daily background license validation checks.</li>
          <li><strong>host_permissions:</strong> Detects SCORM downloads from Articulate servers for when Automatic
            SCORM Patching is enabled.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">3. Pro Mode Licensing & Payments</h3>
        <p class="text-sm mb-4">
          Pro Mode requires license activation using an email address and product key. Licensing is handled through
          <a href="https://www.lemonsqueezy.com/privacy" target="_blank"
            class="text-blue-500 underline">LemonSqueezy</a>,
          a Stripe company. We do not process or store any payment information directly.
        </p>
        <p class="text-sm mb-4">
          License status is validated once every 24 hours using a lightweight Cloudflare Worker proxy. Your license key
          and a machine-specific ID are transmitted only for validation purposes.
        </p>
        <p class="text-sm mb-4">
          To prevent concurrent use, each Pro Mode license is limited to one active device at a time. If you attempt to
          activate your license on a different device, you may be asked to transfer or release the previous session.
        </p>
        <p class="text-sm mb-4">
          For convenience, Pro user preferences and code are stored using <code>chrome.storage.sync</code>,
          which enables automatic syncing between Chrome instances. A snapshot of your license status is also
          temporarily stored here for performance.
        </p>
        <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">4. Website Analytics</h3>
        <p class="text-sm mb-4">
          We use Cloudflare Web Analytics on our website (<strong>overridelabs.ca</strong>) to understand traffic
          patterns.
          This data is anonymized and used solely for internal insights. No analytics or telemetry exist within the
          Chrome Extension.
        </p>
        <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">5. Community Submissions</h3>
        <p class="text-sm mb-4">
          If you submit a custom stylesheet to the Community Style Library, we collect your email address through a
          Google Form. This is used only to contact you about your submission and to grant free Pro Mode access if
          approved.
        </p>
        <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">6. Policy Updates</h3>
        <p class="text-sm mb-4">
          We may update this policy as new features are released or as licensing systems evolve. Please check back
          regularly for the latest version.
        </p>
        <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">7. Contact</h3>
